## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript 
- [SASS](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

- How to use css grid and flex-box together to create a responsive website. 
- Using JavaScript and CSS to create a dark mode theme by applying a class that has styles in it and then inputing the class into the body using classList add.
- creating a toggle button with a slider that activates the dark theme when clicked by using JavaScript's addEvent Listener. 
- Having a gradient as a border for cards. 
- Using Google Chrome Dev tools to demonstrate and see the progress of the website. 
- Creating a responsive website for phone, tablets, and desktops. 
- Hover interactions and what not. 
- Keep the them one even after the website is refreshed by using localStorage.
